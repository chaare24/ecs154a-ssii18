# Lecture Notes

Lecture notes will be posted after each class.
They are divided into their representative portions from each half of the class.

See the [schedule](https://github.com/jlperona-teaching/ecs154a-ssii18/blob/master/syllabus/schedule.csv) for what each set of lecture notes corresponds to.
