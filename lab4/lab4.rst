================
ECS 154A - Lab 4
================

Due by 08:59 on Thursday, 2018-09-13.
This is the same day as the final.
Due to university regulations, I cannot have an assignment due after the start of the final.
Therefore, **you may not submit this assignment late**.
You have been warned.

Turn in for the Logisim portion is on Canvas.
Submit two files, named dmcache.cpp and vm.cpp.
Include your name and your partner's name (if necessary) either as a submission comment on Canvas, or in the text entry box when submitting.
Only one partner needs to submit.

Partners are suggested, but not mandatory for the programming portion of each lab.
Sharing ideas between groups is fine, but sharing C++ source code is not.
Since the written portion is "optional," feel free to do those alone or with your partner.
