================
ECS 154A - Lab 4
================

Due by 09:00 on Thursday, 2018-09-13.
This is the same day as the final.
Due to university regulations, I cannot have an assignment due after the start of the final.
Therefore, **you may not submit this assignment late**.
You have been warned.

Turn in for the Logisim portion is on Canvas.
Submit two files, named *directmapped.cpp* and *setassociative.cpp*.
Include your name and your partner's name (if necessary) either as a submission comment on Canvas, or in the text entry box when submitting.
Only one partner needs to submit.

Partners are suggested, but not mandatory for the programming portion of each lab.
Sharing ideas between groups is fine, but sharing C++ source code is not.
Since the written portion is "optional," feel free to do those alone or with your partner.

Written Problems
----------------

Since this lab spans multiple weeks, the written portion is divided into its representative weeks.

Week 5
~~~~~~

1. Given a 16 KB DM cache with a 21-bit physical address and a line size of 16 bytes, show how a physical address is laid out for use in the cache. Label each portion of the address, and give the number of bits for each portion.
2. Given a 4 KB DM cache with a 15-bit physical address and a line size of 8 bytes, show how a physical address is laid out for use in the cache. Label each portion of the address, and give the number of bits for each portion.
3. Given a 512 byte FA cache with a 12-bit physical address and a line size of 4 bytes, show how a physical address is laid out for use in the cache. Label each portion of the address, and give the number of bits for each portion.
4. Given a 2 KB FA cache with a 27-bit physical address and a line size of 16 bytes, show how a physical address is laid out for use in the cache. Label each portion of the address, and give the number of bits for each portion.
5. Intel's Nehalem architecture in 2008 had an 8 MB 16-way set associative L3 cache, with a line size of 64 bytes. Assuming a 48-bit physical address, show how a physical address is laid out for use in the L3 cache. Label each portion of the address, and give the number of bits for each portion.
6. Given a 512 KB 4-way SA cache with a 30-bit physical address and a line size of 32 bytes, show how a physical address is laid out for use in the cache. Label each portion of the address, and give the number of bits for each portion.
7. Why are logically addressed caches faster than their physically addressed counterparts?
8. What is the cache aliasing problem?
9. What minimizes the number of writes back to memory: a write-through policy, or a write-back policy?
10. Intel CPUs have typically used a multiple-cache hierarchy. The L1 cache is closest to the CPU, while the L3 cache is the furthest away. How does the L3 cache compare to the L1 in terms of the following: power usage, cost, capacity, and speed?

Week 6

C++ Problems [50]
-----------------

Direct-Mapped Cache [25]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file to turn in for this part is *directmapped.cpp*.
You will need to place all your code for this part into one file.
While this isn't necessarily good practice, it means we don't need to deal with Makefiles.

Under construction.

Set-Associative Cache [25]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file to turn in for this part is *setassociative.cpp*.
You will need to place all your code for this part into one file.
While this isn't necessarily good practice, it means we don't need to deal with Makefiles.

Under construction.
